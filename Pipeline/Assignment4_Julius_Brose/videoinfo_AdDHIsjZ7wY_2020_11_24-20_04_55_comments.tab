We know that doctors are a for profit entity and that your quality of life is worst when you go through chemo therapy and is the primary reason most people with cancer die as early as they do. We know that being told you have a terminal illness like cancer creates a power of suggestion that turns into a self fulfilling prophecy. People absolutely think and grieve themselves to death. We know that western civilization has an unhealthy and unnatural relationship with death. It is not natural or healthy to know when or how you&#39;re going to die. It is not natural or healthy for a doctor to sit there and tell you that you have a terminal disease and only x amount of time left to live. Also, almost nobody needs or requests a second opinion about a cancer diagnosis because everyone already knows how our medical industry works and how cancer and chemo therapy are peddled to the masses instead of better diets, vitamins, exercise, and healthier life styles in general. These same concepts of natural vs. unnatural should be applied to everything else in our culture including climate change or any other alarmist issue. It is natural for climate to change, it is natural to eat animals, pain and suffering are just as natural and necessary as pleasure and happiness, it is natural for all things to come to an end. Making any of these issues out to be something alarming is what is wrong, unnatural, and unhealthy. We are only supposed to stress over things just enough to get by day to day.

It&#39;s not. At all.<br />NONE OF THEM have experience actually fixing anything like this. Some point out that the ice core analysis actually contradicts the pattern modern fans of anthropogenic climate change thinks connects CO2 and global warming.<br />And the most level headed of those who say it&#39;s true regardless (using models of the theory they think is true) say that banning all cars in the USA won&#39;t effect it one bit, meanwhile doing so will instantly gut the economy, preventing us from having the means to adapt should the flooding actually come, forcing us to rebuild as the coast line moves.<br /><br />See, the human race won&#39;t just die even if they&#39;re right, it&#39;ll just get harder. We can adapt to harder, we always do, but you CAN&#39;T adapt to harder if the human race goes communist and then loses its civilization agility and resources due to beurocratic malfeasance.<br /><br />This guy wants to sound reasonable, but I don&#39;t find him impressive at all.

If there are 4-5 articles all saying Florida is going to be under water and 2-3 that are saying it isn&#39;t, then you have to look and see where the information is coming from. If the 4-5 articles all get their information from the same source, then it really isn&#39;t any better than only having 1 article.<br /><br />As for cancer, this is one of the reasons that universal healthcare is a bad idea...when the government starts making all the decisions, then the doctors have less flexibility to make their own call based on their own experience. First - all the &quot;learning&quot; comes from the same source. But if there is a federal board making decisions on what is prescribed for what symptoms, it takes the ability for the doctor and patient to make the best choices for them.<br /><br />Case in point - my uncle goes to the VA and they tell him that based on his cholesterol levels, the &quot;established protocol&quot; is to prescribe statin medication. My uncle shows the doctor articles linking statins to increased risk for Alzheimer&#39;s. The doctor says he is aware of the research and agrees with it, but he works for the government and is required to follow the protocol, so he will prescribe statins. My uncle doesn&#39;t take the statins and ends up without access to other options, such as Welchol, which absorbs cholesterol instead of shutting off the body&#39;s mechanisms of producing cholesterol.

If you were saying &quot;Oh, we need to do stuff now or in like a few decades it could be too late due to this, this and this.&quot; Instead, what they do is give an ambigous, ridiculously vague date, say it has to be done now via, usually, taxation, and give them more money to research. Then governments ramp it up for cynical political gains. We were meant to be dead by now. We were meant to be underwater.<br /><br /><br />Now, I believe that we need to do something about our pollution, because that&#39;s just common sense. But you know what? How about force China to do what you forced half of Europe and the Western World to do? China is a &quot;Developing Country&quot; my backside! A tiny country in Africa isn&#39;t going to make a difference, or at least much, BUT CHINA!? You exempt CHINA!? Don&#39;t come complaining to me about Climate Change if you aren&#39;t going to hit India and China, two of the biggest industrial polluters in the world, in the same manner. <br /><br /><br />Also, I will continue to say, go Nuclear and slowly out Coal if it&#39;s so bad. Simplest method, and Nuclear Energy would certainly lower the price of energy too. Produces so much, that despite the higher running costs and building costs, it would even out due to sheer volume.

When water becomes ice does it make more water so that when it melts there&#39;s more than before it was Ice? Doesn&#39;t ice take up more space than water? Does that mean that when the ice melts that the water takes up more area or less? Call me when the South Pole starts to melt considering it&#39;s on top of a land mass and not part of the ocean and would be adding more water to the ocean not just fluctuating between solid and liquid. Especially considering that it seems to be growing a quite a rapid rate at this time. What&#39;s that all about global cooling?

Climate Sciences grants, journals, conferences, have a tremendous pressure to only reinforce the narrative, never to dispute it; the euphemism is &quot;the science is settle&quot;, and a false sense of consensus, &quot;X % of scientist agree.&quot; When scientists have a financial incentive to declare the sky is falling, in order to get grants and publications, all the unscrupulous scientist will flock to that field.<br />What Mr Foer ignored was how, despite all money being poured into the man-made climate change &quot;research&quot;, they all failed to model the climate, and failed in every global temperature prediction. The term &quot;climate change&quot; itself is an admission of failure, because they couldn&#39;t prove &quot;global warming.&quot; So they don&#39;t even bother predicting temperatures, any &quot;change&quot; in the weather is blamed on &quot;climate change.&quot; If it rains tomorrow, it&#39;s climate change. If it doesn&#39;t rain tomorrow, it&#39;s climate change. As Feynman would put it &quot;it&#39;s not even wrong.&quot; If it&#39;s not falsifiable (that is, if you can&#39;t make concrete predictions that can be verified), it&#39;s not science.

Like do you mean short term, or long term predictions? there are many accurate long-term predictions and forecasts about temperature and climate. If you are referring to short-term, one-day temperature predictions, then no, we cannot predict that. But thats the WEATHER, not the overall CLIMATE. I think you may be confusing the two. Another thing you mentioned was "effective course of action". There IS an effective course of action; reduce CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions. That would help preserve the stability of our climates. This is the course of action that would stop man's influence on climate change, but it would have terrible effects on the economy and progress. For this reason I agree with you 100% that innovation and technology is our best bet. And no. Im not saying that there was more man made climate change back then. What im saying is that climate change ALSO existed back then. Ever since the Industrial revolution, the climate has been increasingly volatile and unpredictable. But now, instead of a heatwave once every 10, or 15 years; there is a heatwave every 2 - 3 years. Heres another question for you. How do you explain all of the floodings and cat 5 hurricanes that have been happening? It seems like every couple years we have a "Once in 100 year" flood. To say that humans havent had an influence on this is ignorant. We cannot say forsure that climate change is due solely to human intervention, but there is a positive correlation between emissions and the increase in average global temperature. Finally, very few politicians are calling for those prescriptions. The ones that are suggesting these things, or "Green New Deals", are just imbeciles. But we should without a doubt consider some of these things - in a non-extreme proportion.

The predictions have failed, which means scientists still don't know. But politicians are capitalizing on it, saying "and that's why I should take more of your money." Also, here's a concrete example of malicious extrapolation to create fake science: France went through a heat wave, everyone was crying out how they were the highest temperatures in record, since 1947. Except, if you look it up, you'll actually find this: https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/115683578 a newspaper article from 1930 reporting an even higher temperature. Was there more man-made climate change back then than there are now? Everyone defending climate change policies uses double standards, "the 1930 heat wave was weather, the 2019 heat wave was climate". Or we could go back only a few weeks, when NASA reported that the "fastest shrinking glacier in the world" is actually growing; instead of admitting they don't know what the hell is going on, most scientists just went looking for another glacier to be their "proof that the sky is falling." That doesn't mean I want pollution to continue. I like the environment because I live in it. I'd rather invest in more technology, more efficient ways to use energy, more nuclear power, than to accept silly prescriptions such as pay more taxes, kill all cows, cover perfectly productive farm land with solar panels, forcefully reduce the number of people on the planet, undo the industrial revolution, etc.	UC6FRnbFk4kJsRWwyGpzLBhw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6FRnbFk4kJsRWwyGpzLBhw	1	Ugxwhl2rMEAQUCNd9g54AaABAg	dkosmari

But the fact is that many scientists are making legitimate findings that suggest that if we continue down the path we are currently treading, there will be terrible outcomes. Im not sure what you are referring to by "they dont even bother predicting temperatures". There have been many scientists who have proved that the average global temperature has increased by 1 degree Celsius since the industrial revolution. and that by 2050 it will rise by another degree. there are many theories and projections on the effects this will have on our oceans and ecosystems (none of them good). You are right that science must be falsifiable, but another philosophy of science is that science is a consensus. We can never be certain of external phenomena, but we can fail to reject a theory. So when 97% of all climate scientists agree (this stat is taken from NASA's website) that "climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities"... then we should believe them. Or at least believe them until proven otherwise. The fact is that the evidence for human influence on climate change is OVERWHELMING. Even if our CO2 emissions have a smaller impact on the environment that we think, there are many other ways that our pollution and footprint are affecting the planet - in ways that are easily visible and observable. Example: The giant plastic islands, the fact that animal extinctions are happening 1, 000 times faster due to human intervention, Coral bleaching and the destruction of forests and carbon sinks. references: https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/ https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/5/140529-conservation-science-animals-species-endangered-extinction/	UCyFIVTjCaUGU9LMYG_dob5Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyFIVTjCaUGU9LMYG_dob5Q	1	Ugxwhl2rMEAQUCNd9g54AaABAg	dkosmari

So in the short term it hurts China but in the long term it helps them and increase their investment in other countries which gets them allies down the road. When we don't have those countries as our allies it's harder for use to get things we want from these same countries and weakens our global status.

The carbon cycle is very important but has natural sinks and sources, the combination of the overuse of fossil fuels and carbon sinks such as forests being destroyed are what many scientists believe are causing the global warming and climate change.

They stay employed at universities and end up with nice pensions. Those that disagree are shown the door and not allowed to publish. Believe what you like-there’s evidence for you to find yourself.

It peaked higher than ever recorded _on that one particular date_, but not higher than ever recorded ever. Within three days, as expected, it was already back within the interquartile range. The melt pattern isn&#39;t unseasonal and the annual total has been within normal cyclical variation, but to hear the news reports &quot;RECORD-BREAKING CLIMATE CHANGE MEANS THE PLANET IS ON FUCKING FIRE!&quot; They took ONE data point and caused a panic, and then they act surprised that we question the &quot;settled&quot; apocalyptic narrative.

The earth has been far hotter in times as recently as the Vikings when there was no cars to blame. The earth warms and cools naturally. We are not significant enough to change the atmosphere of the planet as much as we may like to think so. Even if I'm wrong, unless you are suggesting we take down the internet and go back to using candles there is no reversing or even coming close to stopping what they are claiming is causing it. Also you will need to scrap the healthcare system because it incinerates more chemicals and plastics into the air than all the uses of fossil fuels combined. So yeah it's not really an argument. Nobody is going to do anything that actually matters if it's true and no it's not true in the first place. It's a money/power grab.

He mentions that the doctors would have no reason to lie to him. This is not the case, however, with Climate scientists. There funding i.e. income, is predicated on the notion that scientists agree that climate change is happening, that it is catastrophic and that it is human-caused. Note that the foremost hurricane forecaster, Bill Gray, received government funding for his research from 1960 to 1993. It was cut off by the Clinton Admistration since it went against the narrative of global warming and the catastrophic predictions of internet inventor Al Gore. There are plenty of scientists that disagree with man-made global warming including Nobel laureates. There are also scientists who believe in global warming that are are doing research in good faith bute there is a major problem. The science has become so politicized that there is very little room for debate. Personally I have never witnessed a debate by believers and skeptics and would pay to watch that. Unfortunately the global warming cult would never allow this to happen. &quot;Science guy&quot; Bill Nye even thinks climate skeptics (referred to as &quot;deniers&quot; to associate them with Holocaust deniers) should be locked up! We just had the coldest wettest winter on record with almost NO MEDIA COVERAGE! At the very least people should be concerned about the many scandals perpetrated by the climate change alarmists which include revising observed historical temperature observations downward, ignoring problems with temperature stations (90% don&#39;t meet criteria for proper placement) and giving zero credence to other potential causes of climate change - most notably solar activity. Climate alarmist cannot explain the Medieval warm period when the CO2 levels were much lower or the recent &quot;pause&quot; when CO2 went up 15% over the course of just a couple decades. The planet is a much more complex system than can be fully understood and the only way we could show a thorough understanding is by making models that accurately predict future temperatures. Almost ALL of the models that come from climate alarmists over-predict warming, many of them wildly so. When it starts getting cold for a decade or two can we stop all of this nonsense?

Plants thrive on Co2 and give out oxygen, you learn that in primary school.. and volcanic activity produces more carbon emissions than any human nation. That’s why they changed it from global warming to climate change because yes the climate does change funnily enough and at the moment Antarctica is seeing some of the largest ice buildups in the past few decades but they don’t tell you that in the mainstream media, they say flooding and erosion are destroying coastal cites and islands, and that naturally occurring forest fires in Siberia are causing heating in the North Pole, but it’s the middle of summer. But when it’s Christmas there will be snow storms and hurricanes in the northern hemisphere. Humans just forget that we are not meant to stay in one place for too long and we have to move with the earth and sea.

I didn't say a vast majority of scientists are socialist ecofascists. I may have implied it generally, but that is not what I meant. I meant to say that the narrative that our climate is spiraling upwards into catastrophe was originated by evil ideologues. I am saying that much of the scientific data is significantly exaggerated to sustain leftist dogma. I am saying that the alarmism produced by people like AOC is deliberately utilized to gain support for socialist Eco fascism. Also, there was a study from Norway and Japan, that concluded that the impact of low rolling clouds (or something like that: I don't remember very well, because it was several months ago) is greatly neglected in most climate studies, and the impact of those types of clouds is actually quite significant. I am completely denying that the earth is warming and humans are causing it? No. Am I suggesting that the extent of that change is not close to being catastrophic, and the situation is improving with free market solutions? Yes. Am I suggesting that ideologues posing as scientists are intentionally using the highest estimate and exaggerating the probability of that happening to achieve their political and ideological agenda? Definitely. Am I also suggesting that intentionally skewing data is about the least scientific thing someone could do? Absolutely.

See the Green New Deal, for evidence that some people want to push eco facism. The radical alarmism is clearly being used to push for radical change. Any sane person knows that we won't die in twelve years. Any person that is not a leftist ideologue or a liar or both will recognize the insanity of that proposition. The alarmism is clearly dishonestly there to manipulate people and manufacture a crisis worthy of a giant government 'saving the day', by seizing power and control not granted to it by the Constitution. They wouldn't be able to virtue signal, which is their version of secular morality. And, lastly, I read the book "Secret Empires" by Peter Schweitzer, and he made a very interesting claim. He said that establishment leftists (I.e Soros) were investing a lot of money into fossil fuel companies at opportune times, after their stocks went down, because of the regulations they implemented. They could buy and sell stocks optimally, because they heavily influenced the stocks through their policies. So, really, some leftists get the best of both worlds. They play the hypocrite well and get money off fossil fuels, virtue signal, and try to seize unconstitutional power to control people. This last point is very interesting, perhaps not as widespread, and likely requires more investigation, but still very interesting.

Dry places like deserts don't receive rain much because the air currents either flow around them or through a mountain range where all the moisture is dropped before reaching the desert. Some places aren't quite deserts but they are still pretty dry. If a warmer climate shifts the flow of rain a little bit it could get more precipitation or less. Where I live we are 10 inches above normal rain fall for this year. Last year we was 8 inches above normal rain fall. What's your answer for why it keeps getting hotter and I keep getting above average rain fall. I assume your question for what does win against climate look like, was ment to be gotcha but unfortunately for you we actually have an answer.

Climate alarmists in the scientific community that are funded by government institutions do have a politically motivated agenda. The agenda is a takeover of economic systems with the energy sector being the largest as the primary target. The science is not settled but the mainstream media only reports the propaganda of the &quot;policy based science&quot;. The pressure of funding restrictions to bend the scientific community to the will of the politically motivated is so inherently dangerous. This is not science , it is not settled and the proposed actions would make the problem worse while ruining the standard of living of all people. This must be resisted lest we enter an era of widespread poverty, slavery, suffering and death. To climate alarmists like Foer that suggest radical actions, I suggest if you do not understand the science, keep your policy prescriptions to yourself,	UCY3Co0NdnV0i3fVj7nj0R9g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY3Co0NdnV0i3fVj7nj0R9g	0

I'm sure it has nothing to do with a vastly sprawling city with 20 times as many people with wall to wall concrete apartment buildings and the city paved over for huge industrial parks. Beijing is a heat island, like all large cities. I'd put money on it that if you can find temperature records for an area 20 miles from Beijing the temperature would be near flat for the last 100 years - like just about everywhere else where the temperature data hasn't been faked and altered over the last 20-30 years. .

Before the industrial revolution, there were a certain number of trees. And as trees need CO2 to live on we can assume that at that time we were producing enough CO2 to keep all of them alive. Now during and after the Industrial Revolution, we started to cut trees by the millions while adding more CO2 to the environment. Now there is more CO2 in the Atmosphere than the trees that can process them. I think you can draw the obvious conclusion. And yes, I am aware that we are overdue for an Ice age. Not any other kind of weather change. And last time I checked, our planet was getting hotter. So please don't twist it like our planet is overdue for a major climate change so we might as well go in it Guns blazing and hot. Better safe than sorry.

Who do you think is even against it? The fossil fuel companies? They stand to make even more money with renewables, especially with all the tax incentives. Why would you want to sell a non-renewable for a short period of time, when you can milk renewables indefinitely..? Fossil fuel companies are some of the largest lobbyers for green tech, renewables, and carbon credits. When you're a giant company, you can easily absorb those costs, all your smaller competitors can not. It's the same reason Walmart is one of the largest lobbyist for higher minimum wages, it fuels their monopolies. For them, expensive is good.

You base your opinion of climate change based on the « opinion and predictions of scientists » which is fucking stupid . First of all because I’m 90% sure that when you talk about data , you don’t talk about actual data , you’re referring to latest shitty article you read in some newspaper written by some nobody who just regurgitated what he read from a blogger who himself just retold what he read on another blog from someone who read data , misunderstood it , oversimplified it and then spread some misinformation , like with that whole « 4% man-made carbon » because some fucking retard cannot tell the difference between total carbon and carbon flux . You rely on people digesting the information before throwing it up in your face and then since you carefully pick the most retarded and dishonnest ones like Al Gore or AOC it just makes for a fine excuse to point at the dunces and their hyperboles and misinterpretation of data and attribute the blame to the data which you didn’t even consult yourself .

What happened to the global freeze? Why isn’t NYC under water yet? Why isn’t the US a desert? Which one of Al Gores predictions has come true and how many haven’t? We get given their data and their predictions every single week. Their data backs up what they are claiming but at no point do their alarmist predictions ever materialise, which puts the validity of their data in to question. I am happy to fight the cause but when the alarmists are continuously wrong, the solutions are always more tax and redistribution of wealth and less eating of meat, I can’t get on board.

One of the first things I do each morning when I read the paper is to find out what the maximum temperature was on that date, many many times it’s in the 1800s early 1900s.<br />The same thing goes for forest fires. There’s an article in the New York Times where 1200 people died in one day because of heat stroke in the US. It would take me hours to tell you all these things, go and watch some of these videos.

All the climate models have been way off the mark exaggerating warming - that&#39;s all the evidence you need. Technology can overcome all these perceived issues, but yet there&#39;s very little effort to invest in innovation and loads of effort to restrict rights and raise taxes. That&#39;s your first clue that it&#39;s got nothing to do with the environment and everything to do with socialism towards globalism.

What that has to do with socialism and "globalism" I might never know. Also, our models have been accurate, they've successfully reproduced temperatures since 1900 globally, on land, in the air, and in the ocean. But the hyperbole and extreme rhetoric has been unwavering, which is a distraction from the actual dangers of global warming (which has nothing to do with Florida being underwater in three years, whoever made that up).

At leats it is here, Ten years ago we still had the 4 seasons very pronounced. Now we basically have blazing heat in summer and then it goes somehow into muddy territorry and a little bit of snow in Winter. But we don&#39;t even really have the spring we used to have anymore. Or the autumn. Where I live we don&#39;t even get snow anymore, and each year the temperatures in summer are higher and higher. This year we even had over 40 Celcius. Never had that before.

Above a few degrees of warming enzymes in plants get denatured so growth is stopped and the plants die. Temperature can also affect pests and plant diseases. Also there are other factors such as humidity, moisture in the air and soil and rainfall etc. One of the reasons peat bogs and pollen can give us so much information about past climates is that most plants only survive in very specific climates.

But you say it is a “HUGE problem”. But you didn’t describe a problem. You simply stated observations. As a result of that, what exactly is the problem? There’s no denying climate is changing (as it always has) but there’s no 100% consensus on the degree of man-made climate change. Many of you seem to be in an absolute panic over warner weather - cold kills more though - so again, what is the problem? And if there is indeed a problem, what can be done about it? Because the correlation between GAT and CO2 levels is weak, will eliminating fossil fuels even cool the planet (at the risk of killing millions/billions anyway)?

First of all , you saying that my comment doesn’t have any factual information when I clearly stated the exact numbers for population , emissions and emission rate is what is truly staggering . These are , by definition , factuzl information . Secondly , since you seem to be terrible with numbers and language , I’ll try to rephrase for your sake : China produces 10 gigatons of CO2 which is 29.34% of worldwide emissions . The US produces 5 gigatons of CO2 which is 13.77% of worldwide emissions . The disparity in emission rates is not « 10 people emit 10% vs 91 people emit 90% » like you say in your little ineffective euphemism . The US emits 15.7 tons per capita , China emits 7.7 tons per capita . You try to pretend that I said the US were the only ones to blame . I obviously didnnt say that . But in your etricate mind , you have this conception of the issue akin to the way 5th graders tackle conflict : you think that we need to pick one country to blame and then ignore every other country that contributes to the problem . That is not the case . If we place the standard at 5.0 tons per capita , which would be a realistic standard which wouldn’t require people to start living in caves , we notice that the US is much further from that standard than China . So much so in fact that if both countries were to adapt and reach a rate of 5.0 tons per capita , the US would be cutting their emissions by a GREATER AMOUNT (3.4 GT) than China (3.1 GT). If you still dont understand that sentence , here’s a more direct version : the US can realistically do more to reduce global emissions than China . The only way China could decrease by more than 3.1 gigatons (or the US by more than 3.4) would be if they dropped below a 5.0 rate , which would start to mean a a shift in lifestyle . But it turns out , we are not in a situation where we must select a single country which will decrease their emissions . It is a global effort , so BOTH the US AND China must make some effort to lower their CO2 emissions , as well as every other country on the planet . The problem is that YOU see it as a « country vs country thing » , except that , as I told you , what matters is the per capita rate . Because again , if China was to split into a bunch of smaller countries , suddenly each country would be responsible for like 1% , but the global emissions would be exactly the same . As a matter of fact , you can simply take the « country » part out of it : 325 million people produce 5 billion tons , 1.38 produce 10 billion tons . They should both lower to 5 tons per person . Everyone should . The 325 million people are the furthest from it , and would produce a bigger difference in global emissions than the 1.38 billion . Pretty simple . To recycle your hyperbolic analogy with slightly more accurate numbers : let’s say we have a situation where population A of 15 people makes up 30% and population B of 70 people makes up 70% . Then in that case , yes the most impactful population would be population A , because if they managed to lower their pollution to similar rates as population B , total emissions would go down by 15% , whereas , in that scenario , population B is already the least polluting of the two , and you’d ask it to go even lower thzn it currently is while population A keeps polluting at much higher rates .

Remember when Rockefeller paid a bunch of scientists to go to the geneva convention in 1892 and convinced the world that oil was a fossil fuel made from dead plants and animals and that we were running out? contriving a fake supply and demand scarcity so he can increase the prices of oil so he could make more money? or what about the time when the tobacco industry bribed a bunch of doctors to convinced the public that smoking was healthy? or what about when the agriculture industry bribed nutritionists and dietitians to make the food pyramid so they can sell more grain? despite the fact that everything about is wrong and is still being used to this day? I'm not saying i don't believe in climate change, but honestly i'm to illiterate to even comprehend what the data is saying. I know this though, the planet will survive, life will survive, the planet has been through billions of years of asteroid collisions(even our moon was a result of it), solar flares, background radiation, mass extinctions, we on the other hand won't and that's what i'm concerned about.

However, the U.S. is still the #2 emitter in the world. That's more emission than EU-28 combined, and that's many times the number of countries than the U.S.!! Also, sticking to absolute emission by country is also problematic, as China can dissolve into many smaller countries to avoid responsibilities.

Manufacturing produces far more emissions than the individual actions of people. The US and China actually export a similar number of goods. Of course the US can and will do better as technology Improves, but China also has to reign in the pollution caused by their manufacturer in processes. I actually don't think that the left and right are as far apart on this issue as it may appear. Liberals want to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, which is a good goal. Conservatives want to increase the amount of power we receive from nuclear power plants, which is also a good goal. I feel like there is a certain amount of compromise that can be reached there	UCQV_3jXMeb3Zpuvqaak3AWA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQV_3jXMeb3Zpuvqaak3AWA	1	UgzBf8miEFH5A50UDax4AaABAg	Lidia Monroe

If you were to bring them frward in time in our current climate , almost none of them will survive . Likewise , if you were to take the current ecosystem which is adapted to the current climate and put it in a very different , much warmer climate like that of the early Trias , most species would also go extinct . The climate and environment on Earth has varied a lot over the last 500 million years . Some changes were slow and small and had very little incidence because life could adapt . Some were progressive but very impactful in a way that , even when given time , life couldn’t adapt to such a massive change , such as the Permian-Trias extinction which , over a short 3 million years wiped out 95% of species on Earth . Some were instantaneous and brutal like the Chicxulub impact which wiped out the dinosaurs and 50% of life on Earth 66 million years ago . Climate change might seem slow from your perspective as a couple-decades-old human being , but the changes that we are seeing occur in just 150 years are what you would expect over periods upwards of 5000 years . They are happening faster than many lifeforms can adapt to , in certain places the effects are much more important than elsewhere , and just because humans can survive it doesn’t mean that it is desirable or that we shouldn’t try and prevent it or that we shouldn’t prepare for it and preemptively adapt . Humans can survive in antarctica or in the desert , that doesn’t mean I should be fine with my home being turned into one of these climates . The argument doesn’t stand . Our environment is part of our culture ( think of agriculture , local products like wine in France for example) and the least we can do is to preserve our culture .

Let me try this again, just in case your reading compression was temporarily short-circuited. So if one country produces 10 percent of the pollution and has 10 people, they need to be cleaned up before the country that produces 90 percent of the pollution that has 91 people? You expect sane people to buy into this kind of stupidity???	UCupefsfufEAIEUvuHLpskvQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCupefsfufEAIEUvuHLpskvQ	1	UgzBf8miEFH5A50UDax4AaABAg	Lidia Monroe

(Used to be around 19 a couple years prior .) Yes , China is the country with the most CO2 emissions , but it’s also not surprising considering that it makes up 20% of all human populations . If tomorrow , China was to split into a dozen smaller countries , none of them would show up as a big emitter on the charts, yet the situation would remain exactly the same , the amount of pollution would be exactly the same , the only difference is that they’d be attributed to smaller countries . What really matters is emissions per capita , because that allows to really see how much a nation really pollutes relative to its population . Relatively green developed countries like France , Sweden , Denmark etc. Which use renewable OR nuclear energy tend to emit around 5 tons of CO2 per capita without compromisibg a developed way of life . While China isn’t far off and still within an acceptable margin , its emissions have been increasing rapidly which is problematic. However , currently their emissions are in line with what you’d expect a country with 1.4 billion people to produce . India is much lower even . The US however are at 15.7 , which is quite high , especially when considering that the US has a population of 326 millions which is still a big population . If the US adopted more nuclear/renewable energy and reached emission rates similar to other cleaner developed countries , its total emissions would be divided by three and would reduce total worldwide emissions by 3.4 gigatons . If China reached that same rate , it would result in a decrease of 3.1 gigatons . If India reached the same rate as « clean » developed countries , emissions would increase by nearly 6 gigatons , so it’s probably better for India not to develop much . TL;DR China has a shitton of people , The US pollutes a lot more per capita . If the US adopts cleaner energies while maintaining a developped lifestyle , it’ll have a bigger impact on climate change than if China did the same thing .

While I'm a conservative, I see that this climate change debacle is a tug of political/ideological war amongst both sides of the political spectrum. I also see that conservatives tend to not read and study the evidence for this proposed climate crisis in fear of agreeing with the ideological tactics the left tend to use in explaining and attempting to solve the environmental problem, even if some of their data may be valid. While that is fair, we shouldn't immediately disagree with the proposed data by using our political lenses as a convenience. The parent commenter said that we should support Trump the disengagement with China in order to mitigate the proposed climate crisis, which is often a tactic the left use as well in persuading people to agree with their side. The, "if we are concerned about X then we should support Y because Y does Z" is nothing more than political garble from both sides. One should be careful in these types of sayings.
